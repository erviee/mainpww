                <p>MANILA — The Philippines and Australia began their first joint sea and air patrols in the South China
                    Sea on
                    Saturday, days after Manila took similar steps with the U.S. as Pacific nations warily eye an
                    increasingly
                    assertive China.</p>
                <p>The three-day exercises, announced by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on social media,
                    follow
                    discussions by the Philippines and Australia early this year on joint patrols to underscore what
                    they say is
                    their commitment to a rules-based order.</p>
                <p>China claims almost the entire South China Sea, a conduit for more than $3 trillion of annual
                    ship-borne commerce, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and
                    Brunei. The Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2016 said China’s claims had no legal basis.</p><br>
