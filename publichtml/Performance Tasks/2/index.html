        <h3>Davis wasn't able to put Cruz on the canvas on Sunday night, but he did enough to earn the decision</h3>

                <p>When Isaac Cruz stepped in on just over one month's notice to face Gervonta "Tank" Davis, many fans
                    and media members felt Davis was going to face a much tougher test than his originally planned bout
                    with Rolando Romero. It's hard to imagine that was incorrect after Cruz was able to give Davis
                    almost all he could handle for 12 rounds at Los Angeles' Staples Center before Davis was able to
                    pull out a narrow unanimous decision win.</p>
                <p>Davis was able to land many of his trademark power shots in a rare role as the taller man in the
                    fight, but even as his heavy hooks and uppercuts landed, Cruz never appeared hurt. That may have
                    been a product of Davis suffering a hand injury midway through the fight <br>
                    <br>
                    "I hurt my left hand in probably the sixth round but I've got to throw it," Davis said after the
                    fight. "I have to go get it checked out. It's shaking but it is what it is, that's what comes in the
                    sport."
                </p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="column left"> 
                <p>From the opening bell, Cruz fought as he almost always does: bulling his way forward to close the
                    distance and keep his opponent from getting comfortable. Davis, a traditionally slow starter, made
                    the necessary adjustments to Cruz's style beginning around the third round, dialing in with the
                    uppercuts and using movement to keep Cruz from getting inside. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the rounds wore on, whether a product of Cruz's chin, Davis' hand, or both, it was clear Cruz was
                    not going anywhere and he began to turn the momentum of the fight his way, pulling increasingly
                    close on the scorecards as both men continued to land clean, powerful strikes.
                </p>
                <p>Davis was able to do just a little better in just enough rounds to earn the victory, including in
                    what turned out to be the most important round of the fight, picking up Round 12, in a spot that
                    likely saved him from a draw as the official scorecards read 116-112, 115-113, 115-113.</p>
