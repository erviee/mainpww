    <h2>Fighting inequality for a resilient future</h2>
    <p id="paragraph">Tsunamis pose a significant threat to all of us, but they are particularly dangerous for certain
      groups of people, such as women, children, people with disabilities, and older persons. The main objective of this
      year's World Tsunami Awareness Day is to raise consciousness about reducing the risks created by these giant waves
      and improving community preparedness.</p><br>
    <p id="paragraph">Although tsunamis are infrequent, they can have devastating consequences. In the last century,
      only 58 tsunamis have occurred, but they have claimed over 260,000 lives. On average, each disaster has caused the
      death of 4,600 people, more than any other natural hazard (United Nations, 2022).</p><br>
    <p id="paragraph">This year's World Tsunami Awareness Day theme is <mark><q>Fighting Inequality for a Resilient
          Future,</q></mark> which mirrors the subject highlighted during the International Day for Disaster Reduction.
      The observance encourages all sectors of society to engage and collaborate on disaster risk reduction.</p>
